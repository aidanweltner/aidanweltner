## Hello
I'm Aidan, a Web Developer who specialized in PHP frameworks, like WordPress. I love working with PHP, CSS, and simple, elegant JS frameworks like Alpine.js.
- I'm currently freelancing and running my small web agency, (Cottontail Creative)[https://cottontailcreative.com], where I work on WordPress websites, HTML Landing Pages, headless websites, and occassionaly Shopify stores.
- I'm also currently working through improving and refining my (personal portfolio)[https://github.com/aidanweltner/folio22] with a new \(to me\) Laravel-based CMS called (Statamic)[https://statamic.com/]
- I'm currently improving my understanding of Javascript and frameworks like React and Vue \(so far I like Vue most\). I am also always trying to improve my HTML and PHP skills. I've been learning a lot about accessibility, semantic HTML, and I'm improving my OOP patterns in PHP.
- I'm always looking for new, interesting clients who need websites or applications for their businesses. I love working with small businesses and I've not super picky about what platform to use. I'm happy to make reccomendations based on client needs or use whatever the client is comfortable with.
- You can reach me through (my website)[https://cottontailcreative.com] or emailing me directly with first name in front of my website \(cottontailcreative.com\).
